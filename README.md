*It's been known to happen*

Every year at least 8 billion people on this Earth do, indeed, be gaming. It has been known to happen, and no one can explain why. Maybe it's just a hobby, maybe they're mischievous? Maybe... I don't know, maybe they just be gaming...

They might be scheming to game. Which would be odd. Scorn.
